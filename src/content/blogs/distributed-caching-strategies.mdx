Caching is one of the **highest ROI optimizations** in backend engineering.  
Used correctly, it can reduce latency by orders of magnitude and dramatically cut infrastructure costs.

## Why Distributed Caching Matters

At scale:
- Databases become the bottleneck
- Read traffic dominates write traffic
- Latency expectations are extremely low

Distributed caches solve this by serving data **closer to the application** and avoiding repeated database hits.

## Common Distributed Cache Systems

- **Redis** – In-memory, fast, feature-rich
- **Memcached** – Simple, extremely fast
- **Cloud-managed caches** – AWS ElastiCache, Azure Cache for Redis

## Caching Patterns (Interview Favorite)

### 1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)
- App checks cache first
- On miss, fetch from DB and populate cache

**Pros:** Simple, widely used  
**Cons:** Cache misses cause DB spikes

### 2. Read-Through Cache
- Cache sits between app and DB
- Automatically loads data on miss

**Pros:** Cleaner application code  
**Cons:** Less control over behavior

### 3. Write-Through Cache
- Writes go to cache and DB simultaneously

**Pros:** Cache consistency  
**Cons:** Higher write latency

## Cache Invalidation (Hardest Problem)

Strategies include:
- TTL-based expiration
- Explicit invalidation on writes
- Versioned cache keys

> “There are only two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.”

## Real-World Considerations

- Hot keys can overload a single node
- Use consistent hashing for even distribution
- Always plan for cache failures

## Observability & Safety

- Monitor hit/miss ratio
- Set sensible TTLs
- Implement circuit breakers

## Interview Tip

When discussing caching in interviews:
> Always mention **TTL, eviction policies, and failure handling**.

Caching done right is invisible to users — but critical to system success.
