## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.

### Types of Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through rewards

## Common Algorithms

### Linear Regression

Predicting continuous values.

### Decision Trees

Classification and regression trees.

### Neural Networks

Deep learning fundamentals.
