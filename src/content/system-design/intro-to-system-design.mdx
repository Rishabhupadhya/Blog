## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

### Key Concepts

- **Maintainability**: Ease of updates and bug fixes

## Core Principles

### 1. Scalability

Vertical vs Horizontal scaling approaches.

### 2. Load Balancing
