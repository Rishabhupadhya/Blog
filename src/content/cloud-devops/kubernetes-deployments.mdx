## Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform for automating deployment and scaling.

### Core Concepts

- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units
- **Services**: Network abstraction
- **Deployments**: Declarative updates

## Deployment Strategies

### Rolling Updates

Gradually replace old pods with new ones.

### Blue-Green Deployments

Run two identical production environments.

### Canary Deployments

Gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users.
